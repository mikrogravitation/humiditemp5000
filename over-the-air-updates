currently, for ota, only access to files in the root directory is supported.
(otherwise, we might have to create new directories etc, seems complicated)

retrieving files: GET /ota/<filename>

putting files: PUT /ota/<filename>?hmac=<hmac> ...

for putting files, the content length header is required. the binary file contents
are sent unencoded in the request body.

ota updates are signed using symmetric crypto (asymmetric seemed to complicated)
signing updates is not necessary since the devices are already protected by being
in a wifi with restricted access. the signing is here for fun. it's not actually secure.

(if this gets removed, it might be a good idea to replace the hmac with a simple sha256
checksum. this was how it was before i added the hmac.)

each device has a device key stored in the file "device_ota_key" in the root directory.
this is used to check macs.

to compute the mac, take the filename (only the filename, remember we only support updating
files in the root directory, so a full path is not necessary), and prepend it to the contents
of the file, separated by a space character. the filename may not contain spaces, so this is
not ambiguous. then, compute the hmac-sha256 (using the device key) over this construction, and
encode the results as a hex string.

hmac = hexlify(hmac_sha256(device_key, <filename> + " " + <file contents>))
